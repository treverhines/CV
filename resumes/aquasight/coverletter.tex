\makelettertitle

I am a PhD student in Geophysics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and I anticipate graduating in April 2017.  Throughout my five years as a graduate student, I have developed skills and experience in data analysis that would make me a valuable asset to Aquasight. As requested in the position posting, I have a deep theoretical and practical understanding of supervised machine learning. I also have years of experience with Kalman filtering, which can be used to convert raw data streams into accurate, real-time intelligence.  While I have the requisite experience, I am also eager to learn and keep up to date with the latest techniques in data analysis. I believe this passion for learning will make me well suited for the energetic start-up environment at Aquasight. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your response.
