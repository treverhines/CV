I am applying for the research scientist position at ISciences. I am a PhD student in Geophysics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and I anticipate graduating in August 2017. My research involves analyzing geospatial data to try to better understand processes related to plate tectonics. For example, I have used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to analyze how the ground deforms after earthquakes. Throughout my five years as a graduate student, I have developed a set a skills and techniques for geospatial data analysis.  I believe that these skills will make me a valuable asset to ISciences. I have attached my resum\'e and I look forward to your response.
